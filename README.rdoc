= WorkLogger
We have come up with a system that logs our work in JIRA automatically when we commit changes in git.

== Installation
Once your project is initialized with Git, your project folder shall contain a hidden folder called .git

1. Install ruby through RVM.
  rvm install <version_name>

2. Save your JIRA username and password in environment. (For linux, run "sudo vim ~/.bashrc" and add  the following lines at the end of file)
  export USER_NAME="your user name"
  export PASSWORD="your jira password"
  export CORPORATE_URL="your corporate url"

Restart the terminal window after setting up the above credentials.
3. run 'worklogger'

All set! Now exit the terminal and login again and you are good to go!

Now every time you wish to log your work, just commit with following syntax and see the magic happen:

  git commit -m "issue=ABC-100 time=3h30m commit message goes here"
