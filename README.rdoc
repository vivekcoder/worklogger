= WorkLogger
We have come up with a system that logs our work in JIRA automatically when we commit changes in git.

== Installation
Once your project is initialized with Git, your project folder shall contain a hidden folder called .git

Install ruby through RVM.
  rvm install <version_name>

Save your JIRA username and password in environment. (For linux, run "sudo vim ~/.bashrc" and add  the following lines at the end of file)
  export USER_NAME="your user name"
  export PASSWORD="your jira password"
  export CORPORATE_URL="your corporate url"

  Restart the terminal window after setting up the above credentials.
Intall worklogger

  gem install worklogger

== Usage
To begin, do

    worklogger init

Now every time you wish to log your work, just commit with following syntax and see the magic happen:

  git commit -m "issue=ABC-100 time=3h30m commit message goes here"

For standalone logging of work,

    worklogger log

All set! Now exit the terminal and login again and you are good to go!
