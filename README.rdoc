= WorkLogger
Worklogger is a system that logs your work in JIRA automatically when you commit changes in git. Work can be logged also when you don't want to commit your code but still log your work against any issue on JIRA.

== Installation
Once your project is initialized with Git, your project folder shall contain a hidden folder called .git

Install ruby through RVM.
  rvm install <version_name>

Save your JIRA username and password in environment. (For linux, run "sudo vim ~/.bashrc" and add  the following lines at the end of file)
  export USER_NAME="your user name"
  export PASSWORD="your jira password"
  export CORPORATE_URL="your corporate url"

Note: corporate url would be something this way: https://company-name.atlassian.net

Restart the terminal window after setting up the above credentials.
Install worklogger

  gem install worklogger

== Usage
To begin using with git commit, do

    worklogger init

Now every time you wish to log your work, just commit with following syntax and see the magic happen:

  git commit -m "issue=ABC-100 time=3h30m commit message goes here"

For standalone logging of work,

    worklogger log
